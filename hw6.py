def scrape_all_movies(url):
    """Uses the requests and beautifulsoup modules to extract the movie names and urls from
    an actor's IMDb webpage. Returns a dictionary of all of the
    extracted movies. The keys are the movie titles, and the values
    are the corresponding urls (in string form) to that movie. The dictionary
    includes all types of filmography the given actor acted in. This can include
    TV shows, shorts, TV movies, and documentaries. It does not return filmography
    in which the person is credited only with a role other than actor (director, writer, etc).
